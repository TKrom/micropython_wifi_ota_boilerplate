"""
NOTE: The Over The Air (OTA) updates will only update the /app directory. All other files (such as in the root directory)
will not be updated. Make sure that you setup new devices with the correct root files as well. For instance the
networks.json file containing your specific WiFi hotspots of preference. Also the wifi_manager directory should be present.
The integrated WiFi manager will automatically connect to the closest WiFi hotspot you specify in the networks.json file.
If no such station is found within reasonable time, the device will setup its own AP hotspot, with which you can connect,
and then use the WEB REPL and communicate with the device as well. WEB REPL is also reachable when using regular wifi.
